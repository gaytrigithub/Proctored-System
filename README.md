# Proctored-System
Remote proctoring is the act of invigilating an online exam from any location to clamp down on aberrant behavior or cheating instances to ensure a cheat-free assessment environment. A remotely proctored exam is administered by experienced human proctors, an AI Algorithm, or both to maintain integrity.
